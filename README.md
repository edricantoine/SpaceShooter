# SpaceShooters
## A retro-inspired 2D shoot-'em-up game.

This application is a simple 2D shoot-'em-up game (think Space Invaders), which I decided to create as a way to get some practice with the C++ language as well as learn the basics of game development using the SDL2 graphics framework. I think the gameplay is simple enough to understand, and doesn't really require much explaining.

I hope you enjoy!
